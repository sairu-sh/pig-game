A two player die rolling game. Players will roll the die and accumulate the points till they reach 30 points. The player to first reach 30 points will win.
If the die rolls 2-6, it will be added to the current points of that player. The player then can choose to either add the current points to the total points 
or to roll the die again. If player rolls a 1, they lose all their current point but not their total score.The turn changes when the player rolls a 1
or they choose to hold their current points.

This is a learning project from the JavaScript course, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022 From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann. The HTML and CSS 
code are written by Jonas.
<br>
The JS component however, is written from scratch. The JS component contains basic DOM manipulation, nested if-else conditional and function calls with the
added complexity of switching the players.
